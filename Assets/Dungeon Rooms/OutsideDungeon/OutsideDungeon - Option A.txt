You walk through the massive stone gate and are surrounded by old stone walls lit by flickering torches that are hung on unreachable heights.
You hear a loud bang behind you. The massive gate closed in a sudden move and it doesn't seem to open up again.

You're locked inside.

You can't stop thinking about what a massive mistake this was.
But you won't give up that easily and are determined to find a way back to the outside that you took for granted a short while ago.
