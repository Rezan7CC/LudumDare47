You ignore the dungeon and continue riding your bike home. Your dog seems thankful for your quick return while it happily feasts on the dog food you prepared.

Sometimes you tell your grandchildren about the dungeon that you ignored at a young age with regretful tones and wished you would have explored what that dungeon entailed.
