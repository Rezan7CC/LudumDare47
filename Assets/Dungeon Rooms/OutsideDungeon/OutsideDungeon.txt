You're returning home after a work shift that was longer than usual.
Usually you ride your bike on the lit town path but you can't stop thinking about your dog hungrily awaiting its evening meal
so you decide to take a shortcut through the forest.

You ride into the forest for a couple minutes until you discover something that you never noticed on this path yet.
On the side of the path you can see a massive stone gate leading into an old structure.
You carefully take a peak inside and it looks like a dungeon.
