With your torch youÂ´re finally able see what lies behind the shadows.

You explore the sides and corners of the room and find a water flask on the ground.
This seems useful and you reach for it.

Once you pick it up you feel a strange energy pulsating through your body.
There is a sudden, white flash in front of your eyes. Just a moment later you find yourself in the first dungeon room again.
Your backpack feels a little bit heavier.
