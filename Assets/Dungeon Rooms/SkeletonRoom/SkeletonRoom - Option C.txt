Quickly you swing the wooden club onto the skeletons's head.
The skeleton falls into pieces instantly.

The bones on the ground look pretty sweet and you reach for one.

Once you picked it up you feel a strange energy pulsating through your body.
There is a sudden, white flash in front of your eyes. Just a moment later you find yourself in the first dungeon room again.
Your backpack feels a little bit heavier.
