You open the door and step inside.

ItÂ´s a dark room. In the center of the room there is fancy pedestal with a large, round gem placed on it.
The shape of the gem seems familiar to you. 

You walk towards the pedestal but your approach is interrupted by loud belling from the side.
A huge hound with dark fur emerges from the shadows. The hound looks starved and approaches you in an aggressive stance while revealing its massive teeth.
