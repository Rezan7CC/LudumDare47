The hound seems hungry so you open a can of dog food and place it on the ground.
After sniffing the scent of the freshly opened can of dog food, the hound carefully approaches it and starts feasting on it while happily wagging its tail.

The threat is eliminated so finally you approach the pedestal and reach out for the round gem. 

Once you picked it up you feel a strange energy pulsating through your body.
There is a sudden, white flash in front of your eyes. Just a moment later you find yourself in the first dungeon room again.
Your backpack feels a little bit heavier.
