The hound seems hungry so you throw the skeleton bones towards it.
After carefully investigating the bones, the hound starts biting into them and seems satisfied.

The threat is eliminated so finally you approach the pedestal and reach out for the round gem. 

Once you picked it up you feel a strange energy pulsating through your body.
There is a sudden, white flash in front of your eyes. Just a moment later you find yourself in the first dungeon room again.
Your backpack feels a little bit heavier.
