You're feeling very creative and swing your rope ladder across the giant block of ice.
This allows you to climb it which you follow up on straight ahead.

You successfully reach the top and take your first steps on it. However you weren't prepared for how slippy it is.
You take a wrong step, stumble awkwardly and fall down from the block of from a dangerous height.

What were you trying to achieve anyway?

There is a sudden, white flash in front of your eyes. Just a moment later you find yourself in the first dungeon room again.
