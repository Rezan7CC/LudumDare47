Many minutes pass and it seems like you're walking deep into the dungeon.

Finally the path leads into a large room.
There is a giant block of ice in the center of the room. The block is surrounded by a puddle of water so the ice seems to be melting slowly.
But you can't explain where it comes from or why it didn't fully melt already.
In the center of the block of ice you can see an old, rusty key trapped inside of it.

On the right of the block of ice you see a staircase leading downwards to another level.
On the left side you spot an entrance to a path in the top, right corner of the wall. However it doesn't seem reachable from down here.
