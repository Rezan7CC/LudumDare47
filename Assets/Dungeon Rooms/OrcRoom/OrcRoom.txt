At the bottom of the stairs there is a wooden door.

You open up the door and surprise a green orc with a wooden club relaxing by its fireplace.
The orc is annoyed by the disturbance and readies to attack.

There is a table close to you with a dagger lying on top of it.
Behind the orc there is a torch hanging on the wall. This one hangs lower and seems reachable.
